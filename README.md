# Structured data from LangSci books

## About

This repository provides linguistic example sentences in XML
format that were extracted from open access books published with
[Language Science Press](http://langsci-press.org/).
There are both glossed and unglossed sentences, depending on the
original source.

The actual data files are located in the `data` directory. Their structure
is described by the RELAX NG schema in `schemas/LinguisticExamples.rnc`.

## Documentation

For a short and gentle introduction to linguistic example sentences
and their XML representation in this repository, have a look at our
[user guide](https://github.com/langsci/lsp-xml/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md).

In addition, we provide some
[Python demo code](https://github.com/langsci/lsp-xml/blob/master/code/explore-lspxml.py)
that illustrates how the XML files can be parsed and used. The
[user guide](https://github.com/langsci/lsp-xml/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md)
also contains a short description of the demo code.

## Data sources

The files in the `data` directory are named after the main author or
editor of the book from which the examples were extracted.
