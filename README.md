# lsp-xml: Structured linguistic data from LSP books

## About

The `data` directory contains linguistic example sentences in XML
format that were extracted from open access books published with
[Language Science Press](http://langsci-press.org/). The structure of
these XML files is described by the RELAX NG schema in
`schemas/LinguisticExamples.rnc`. There are both glossed and unglossed
sentences, depending on the original source.

The files are named after the main author or editor of the book from
which the examples were extracted. In particular:

- `cangemi.xml`: examples from
  [Prosodic detail in Neapolitan Italian](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/16)
  by Francesco Cangemi.

- `handschuh.xml`: examples from
  [A typology of marked-S languages](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/18)
  by Corinna Handschuh.

- `klamer.xml`: examples from
  [The Alor-Pantar languages: History and typology](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/22)
  edited by Marian Klamer.

- `wilbur.xml`: examples from
  [A grammar of Pite Saami](http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/17)
  by Joshua Wilbur.
